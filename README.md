This script is custom made for parsing a messed up CDR log by a AASTRA(Mitel) PBX. You possibly cannot use this script without changing it for your use.

This script is shared for backlog and to learn from.

Best regards and good luck with restoring your CDR logs.

( This script was made because the initial CDR messed up with spaces all over the place, therefor we break down the format and reconstruct it from there )
